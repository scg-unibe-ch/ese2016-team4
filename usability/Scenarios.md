#Usability Testing Tasks

The customer has to think aloud i.e. he has to say what he is doing.

##Scenario 1
You will work in switzerland for the next years. Not long ago you received an heritage. Therefore you search for a house. A friend proposed you the page localhost:8080 :). You load that page and you search for an auction of a house because you like the auction thrill and you place the lowest possible bid.

##Scenario 2
You are John Wayne and want your best friend Jane to move to switzerland. Therefore you log in on your favorite page flatfindr (login: ese@unibe.ch | ese). Then you search a room or studio to rent where the price is max 700 and Jane can bring her dog Herbert you miss so much.
You send her the link of the results in a message on flatfindr.


##Scenario 3
Your best friend John Wayne told you he sent you the link of interesting ad's in a message on your favorite page flatfindr. Log in (jane@doe.com | password) and check your message inbox. Open the message from John Wayne and open the link in a new tab.
